# keylogger
Just getting started in learning about cybersecurity, and this is one of the mini-projects I recently built to learn about hacking and information security 
while building my coding skills: a keylogger in Python. While running, this script enables a user to record the keystrokes from a keyboard and store them 
in text format. Please note that this script was created for educational purposes only. The original project can be found on 
https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/write-a-keylogger-python.
